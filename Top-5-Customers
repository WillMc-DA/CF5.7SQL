-- The first thing I noticed from the previous query (Top-10-Cities) is that all cities, but the top 1, only had 1 customer each. 
-- Querying just the Top 10 cities that SQL showed us/selected for us would be a flaw in our thinking, if the next 100 cities also had 1 customer in them.
-- My query, still checks the Top 10 countries, but calculates the Total Paid by any and all customers in those 10 countries.
